# ReactVideoTube

This is my first React JS app which is developed following a tutorial of Stephen Grider.

#### Getting Started
Checkout this repo, install dependencies, then start the gulp process with the following:

```
> git clone https://github.com/sahesh/ReactVideoTube.git
> cd ReactVideoTube
> npm install
> npm start
```
